# Stock-Picker
In this project I need to implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

I don't know where to start. I need to choose somehow the first min number from the left side and it max number after the first.
